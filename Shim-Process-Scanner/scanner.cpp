<insert Awesome professional page header here>:
Windows x64 Process Scanner to detect application compatability shims

I applogize for:
The commented out code
The mixed conventions
Ineffient code
I did a lot of unneccary things, and this was a learning project for me - especially when dealing with undocumented structs, and programming for x64.
The debug building fails and I can't remember how to fix it- but release will work :-)


Want to add:
cmd parameters for scanning a spefic process, showing debugging, verbose, etc
continious scan?
